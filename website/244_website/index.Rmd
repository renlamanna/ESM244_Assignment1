I am Master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. I am specializing in Coastal Marine Resource Management and am eager to build a career in which I can create sustainable coastal communities that are resilient to climate change. I am especially interested in coastal resilience in the face of climate change in severely at risk communities, such as island nations. Aside from that, I spend my free time with other people's doggos because I am not yet mature enough for my own.
